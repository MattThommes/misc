Miscellaneous scripts
==========

These are my miscellaneous scripts that don't yet fit in to a more formal repository.

## google_maps.php

[See here](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/tutorial#api_key) on how to generate your API key. Put that value in `google_maps_auth.php` file. The contents should look like:

	<?php

		// your Google Maps API key.
		$auth_key = "";

	?>
